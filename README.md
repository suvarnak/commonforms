# CommonForms

ðŸª„ Automatically convert a PDF into a fillable form.

[ðŸ’» Hosted Models (detect.semanticdocs.org)](https://detect.semanticdocs.org) | [ðŸ“„ CommonForms Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16506) | [ðŸ¤— Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jbarrow/CommonForms) | [ðŸ¤— FFDNet-L](https://huggingface.co/jbarrow/FFDNet-L) | [ðŸ¤— FFDNet-S](https://huggingface.co/jbarrow/FFDNet-S)

![Pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbarrow/commonforms/main/assets/pipeline.png)

This repo contains three things:
1. the pip-installable `commonforms` package, which has a CLI and API for converting PDFs into fillable forms
2. the FFDNet-S and FFDNet-L models from the paper [CommonForms: A Large, Diverse Dataset for Form Field Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16506) 
3. the preprocessing code for the CommonForms dataset, which is hosted on HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/datasets/jbarrow/CommonForms


## Installation

CommonForms can be installed with either `uv` or `pip`, feel free to choose your package manager flavor:

```sh
uv pip install commonforms
```

Once it's installed, you should be able to run the CLI command on ~any PDF.

## CommonForms CLI

The simplest usage will run inference on your CPU using the default suggested settings:

```
commonforms <input.pdf> <output.pdf>
```

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| ![Input PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbarrow/commonforms/main/assets/input.png) | ![Output PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbarrow/commonforms/main/assets/output.png) |

### Command Line Arguments

| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `input` | Path | Required | Path to the input PDF file |
| `output` | Path | Required | Path to save the output PDF file |
| `--model` | str | `FFDNet-L` | Model name (FFDNet-L/FFDNet-S) or path to custom .pt file |
| `--keep-existing-fields` | flag | `False` | Keep existing form fields in the PDF |
| `--use-signature-fields` | flag | `False` | Use signature fields instead of text fields for detected signatures |
| `--device` | str | `cpu` | Device for inference (e.g., `cpu`, `cuda`, `0`) |
| `--image-size` | int | `1600` | Image size for inference |
| `--confidence` | float | `0.3` | Confidence threshold for detection |
| `--fast` | flag | `False` | If running on a CPU, you can trade off accuracy for speed and run in about half the time |


## CommonForms API

In addition to the CLI, you can use

```py
from commonforms import prepare_form

prepare_form(
    "path/to/input.pdf",
    "path/to/output.pdf"
)
```

All of the above arguments are keyword arguments to the `prepare_form` function.

## Interactive Streamlit App

For fine-tuned control over field detection, use the interactive web interface:

```sh
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The Streamlit app provides:
- **Adjustable confidence threshold** - Lower the confidence score if desirable fields aren't detected
- **Visual field selection** - Preview detected fields on each page and choose which ones to make fillable
- **Interactive editing** - Uncheck fields you don't want to include in the final PDF

This is especially useful when the default settings miss important form fields or detect unwanted elements.

## Dataset Prep

ðŸš§ Code for dataset prep exists in the `dataset` folder.

## Troubleshooting

If form fields aren't being detected:
1. Use the Streamlit app to adjust the confidence threshold (try lowering from 0.3 to 0.1-0.2)
2. Visually inspect detected fields and manually select which ones to include
3. For better accuracy, use `--model FFDNet-L` instead of `FFDNet-S`
